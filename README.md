Welcome to the repository of my **2D top-down video game project**, developed with **Godot 4**. This game is heavily inspired by **cyberpunk aesthetics** and **phonk music**, creating a dark and immersive atmosphere.

## Synopsis

The player takes on the role of a **test subject** who has undergone experiments that granted them mysterious abilities. Waking up in a **dilapidated futuristic city** with no clear memories, they begin to uncover the truth: the entire city is an **illusion**, a large-scale social experiment akin to *The Truman Show*.

## Development Goals

### üéÆ Gameplay
- Smooth **movement system** with **dash mechanics**.
- **Enemies and NPCs** with interactive elements.
- Level design that promotes **natural player guidance**.
- Mechanics will continue to be expanded in future updates.

### üèôÔ∏è Level Design
- The game starts in a **dark alley**, where the protagonist wakes up on a couch.
- A **locked door** prevents movement downward.
- The player is led towards a **tower**, where the main antagonist is introduced.
- Multiple **map tests** have already been conducted to refine the environment.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Elements
- Built with **Godot 4**.
- **Pixel art** graphics with a **dark and immersive artistic direction**.
- **GitHub repository** used to track development progress and document changes.

## About the Developer

I am passionate about **sound engineering, game development, and immersive storytelling**. This project is my attempt to merge **cyberpunk aesthetics** with the raw energy of **phonk music**, creating a unique interactive experience. My goal is to build an engaging world that tells a story through its environments, mechanics, and sound design.

I often struggle with **insomnia**, which fuels my late-night development sessions, but I also have a **weed addiction** that sometimes slows me down. Despite this, I remain dedicated to pushing the project forward and refining the gameplay experience.
